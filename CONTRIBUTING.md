If you would like to contribute a quote, edit the file `data-raw/quotes_raw.txt` and then submit a pull request.
Use this template for the fields in a new quotation:

```
% Comment - ignored
quo: This is a quotation.
src: Person or persons who said or wrote the quote.
cit: Citation for the original quote.
url: URL where the quote can be found (such as journal articles).
tag: Comma-separated tags to categorize the quote.
tex: TeX-formatted citation
```

The package maintainer will then run the script `data-raw/convert_quotes_to_rdata.R` prior to releasing the package.
