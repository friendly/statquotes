## statquotes package released to CRAN

The statquotes package v. 0.2 has recently been released to CRAN.  In a spirit
similar to fortunes and gaussfacts, the function `statquote()`  
displays a randomly chosen quotation from a data base consisting
of quotes about topics related to statistics, data visualization and science. 

The data base is a collection of quotations assembled over the years from various
sources. The quotes are classified by general topics (and subtopics).

### Examples

> set.seed(761)
> statquote()
The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard. 
--- John W. Tukey 
> statquote(topic="science")
Some people weave burlap into the fabric of our lives, and some weave gold thread. Both contribute 
to make the whole picture beautiful and unique. 
--- Anon. 

### Development
