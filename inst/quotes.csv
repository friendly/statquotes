8,"Data visualization","","If one technique of data analysis were to be exalted above all others for its ability to be revealing to the mind in connection with each of many different models, there is little doubt which one would be chosen. The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device. It specializes in providing indications of unexpected phenomena.","John W. Tukey "

19,"Data visualization","","Tables are like cobwebs, like the sieve of Danaides; beautifully reticulated, orderly to look upon, but which will hold no conclusion.

Most of us need to listen to the music to understand how beautiful it is. But often that's how we present statistics; we just show the notes, we don't play the music.","Hans Rosling, OECD World Forum, Istanbul, June 2007"
24,"Data visualization","","The greatest possibilities of visual display lie in vividness and inescapability of the intended message. A visual display can stop your mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can force you to notice what you never expected to see.","John W. Tukey "
25,"Data visualization","","The purpose of [data] display is comparison (recognition of phenomena), not numbers ... The phenomena are the main actors, numbers are the supporting cast.","John W. Tukey "

27,"Data visualization","","Around the turn of the century, Karl Pearson, an almost elemental force for more and better statistical thought in all areas of life, including with gusto, matters of social policy, was thinking and lecturing about graphical methods. But later in Pearson's life, and certainly in the careers of R. A. Fisher and the other great statistical minds of the first half of the century, there was a falling away of interest in graphics and an efflorescence  of devotion to analytical mathematical methods. Indeed, for many years there was a contagious *snobbery* against so unpopular, vulgar and elementary a topic as graphics among academic statisticians and their students","William Kruskal "
28,"Data visualization","","If statistical graphics, although born just yesterday, extends its reach every day, it is because it replaces long tables of numbers and it allows one not only to embrace at glance the series of phenomena, but also to signal the correspondences or anomalies, to find the causes, to identify the laws.","Emile Cheysson, c. 1877"

34,"Data visualization","","Mr. Funkhouser has made an extremely interesting and valuable contribution to the history of statistical method. I wish, however, that he could have added a warning, supported by horrid examples, of the evils of the graphical method unsupported by tables of  figures. Both for  accurate understanding, and particularly to facilitate the use of the same material by other people, it is essential that graphs should not be published by themselves, but only when supported by the tables which lead up to them. It would be an exceedingly good rule to forbid in any scientific periodical the publication of graphs unsupported by tables.","John Maynard Keynes, review of Funkhouser for The Economic Journal http://www.jstor.org/stable/2224943"

49,"Data visualization","Pictures","When a law is contained in figures, it is buried like metal in an ore; it is necessary to extract it.  This is the work of graphical representation. It points out the coincidences, the relationships between phenomena, their anomalies, and we have seen what a powerful means of control it puts in the hands of the statistician to verify new data, discover and correct errors with which they have been stained.","Emile Cheysson, Les m\ethods de la statistique (1890), 34-35."

165,"Science","","I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the ``Law of Frequency of Error.'' The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason.

166,"Science","","In scientific thought we adopt the simplest theory which will explain all the facts under consideration and enable us to predict new facts of the same kind. The catch in this criterion lies in the world ``simplest.'' It is really an aesthetic canon such as we find implicit in our criticisms of poetry or painting. The layman finds such a law as $dx/dt = K(d^2x/dy^2)$ much less simple than ""it oozes,"" of which it is the mathematical statement. The physicist reverses this judgment, and his statement is certainly the more fruitful of the two, so far as prediction is concerned.
