Science,Generalizations,"A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a master of pattern.

The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces.","Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic Presentation",,
Data visualization,Pictures,"Graphs carry the message home. A universal language, graphs convey information directly to the mind. Without complexity there is imaged to the eye a magnitude to be remembered. Words have wings, but graphs interpret. Graphs are pure quantity, stripped of verbal sham, reduced to dimension, vivid, unescapable.","Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic Presentation",,
Data visualization,Pictures,"Graphs are all inclusive. No fact is too slight or too great to plot to a scale suited to the eye. Graphs may record the path of an ion or the orbit of the sun, the rise of a civilization, or the acceleration of a bullet, the climate of a century or the varying pressure of a heart beat, the growth of a business, or the nerve reactions of a child.","Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic Presentation"
Data visualization,Pictures,"The graphic art depicts magnitudes to the eye. It does more. It compels the seeing of relations. We may portray by simple graphic methods whole masses of intricate routine, the organization of an enterprise, or the plan of a campaign. Graphs serve as storm signals for the manager, statesman, engineer; as potent narratives for the actuary, statist, naturalist; and as forceful engines of research for science, technology and industry. They display results. They disclose new facts and laws. They reveal discoveries as the bud unfolds the flower.","Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic Presentation",,
Data visualization,Pictures,"The graphic language is modern. We are learning its alphabet. That it will develop a lexicon and a literature marvelous for its vividness and the variety of application is inevitable. Graphs are dynamic, dramatic. They may epitomize an epoch, each dot a fact, each slope an event, each curve a history. Wherever there are data to record, inferences to draw, or facts to tell, graphs furnish the unrivalled means whose power we are just beginning to realize and to apply.","Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic Presentation",,
Data visualization,Pictures,"Functional visualizations are more than innovative statistical analyses and computational algorithms. They must make sense to the user and require a visual language system that uses colour, shape, line, hierarchy and composition to communicate clearly and appropriately, much like the alphabetic and character-based languages used worldwide between humans.","Matt Woolman, Digital Information Graphics",,

In two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square wit four terminal points?
In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce - did not the eyes of mine behold it - that blessed being, a Cube, with eight terminal points?
And in Four Dimensions, shall not a moving Cube - alas, for Analogy, and alas for the Progress of Truth if it be not so - shall not, I say the motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine organization with sixteen terminal points?","Edwin A. Abbott, Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions",,
