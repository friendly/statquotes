"Science","","It is strange that only extraordinary men make the discoveries, which later appear so easy and simple.","Georg C. Lichtenberg",""
"Science","","Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.","Albert Einstein",""
"Science","","Facts, however numerous, do not constitute a science. Like innumerable grains of sand on the sea shore, single facts appear isolated, useless, shapeless; it is only when compared, when arranged in their natural relations, when crystallised by the intellect, that they constitute the eternal truths of science","William Farr, ""Observation,"" Br. Ann. Med. 1 (1837): 693",""
"Data","","Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way","Hadley Wickham",""
"Data","","We cannot understand the world without numbers, and we cannot understand it with numbers alone.","Hans Rosling",""
"Data","","Bad data makes bad models. Bad models instruct people to make ineffective or harmful interventions. Those bad interventions produce more bad data, which is fed into more bad models; it's a 'data-cascade.","@doctorow https://onezero.medium.com/machine-learnings-crumbling-foundations-bd11efa22b0",""
"Data visualization","Pictures","Whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new Diagram","Florence Nightingale, Letter 1857.8.19 to Sidney Herbert",""
"Data visualization","Pictures","DIAGRAMS are of great utility for illustrating certain questions of vital statistics by conveying ideas on the subject through the eye, which cannot be so readily grasped when contained in figures.","Florence Nightingale, Mortality of the British Army. 1858. Page 1.",""
"Statistics","","Statistics is the art of stating in precise terms that which one does not know.","William Kruskal",""
"Statistics","","Again I must repeat my objections to intermingling causation with statistics. It might be to a certain extent admissible if you had no sanitary head. But you have one, & his report should be quite separate. The statistician has nothing to do with causation: he is almost certain in the present state of knowledge to err.","Florence Nightingale, Letter, March 1861",""
"Statistics","","A Bayesian is one who, vaguely expecting a horse, and catching a glimpse of a donkey, strongly believes he has seen a mule.","Stephen John Senn @stephensenn",""
