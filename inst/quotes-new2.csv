233,"Statistics","","Statistical accounts are to be referred to as a dictionary by men of riper years, and by young men as a grammar, to teach them the relations and proportions of different statistical subjects, and to imprint them on the mind at a time when the memory is capable of being impressed in a lasting and durable manner, thereby laying the foundation for accurate and valuable knowledge.","William Playfair, The Statistical Breviary  (1801), 5-6."
234,"Statistics","","Geography is only a branch of statistics, a knowledge of which is necessary to the well-understanding of the history of nations, as well as their situations relative to each other.","William Playfair, The Commercial and Political Atlas, p. 29"

236,"Data visualization","Pictures","DIAGRAMS are of great utility for illustrating certain questions of vital statistics by conveying ideas on the subject through the eye, which cannot be so readily grasped when contained in figures.","Florence Nightingale, Mortality of the British Army, 1857"
237,"Data visualization","Pictures","To give insight to statistical information it occurred to me, that making an appeal to the eye when proportion and magnitude are concerned, is the best and readiest method of conveying a distinct idea.","William Playfair, The Statistical Breviary (1801), p. 2"
238,"Data visualization","Pictures","Regarding numbers and proportions, the best way to catch the imagination is to speak to the eyes.","William Playfair, Elemens de statistique, Paris, 1802, p. XX."
239,"Data visualization","Pictures","The aim of my carte figurative is to convey promptly to the eye the relation not given quickly by numbers requiring mental calculation.","Charles Joseph Minard"
240,"Data visualization","Pictures","Information that is imperfectly acquired, is generally as imperfectly retained; and a man who has carefully investigated a printed table, finds, when done, that he has only a very faint and partial idea of what he has read; and that like a figure imprinted on sand, is soon totally erased and defaced.","William Playfair, The Commercial and Political Atlas (p. 3), 1786"
241,"Data visualization","Pictures","Since the aim of exploratory data analysis is to learn what seems to be, it should be no surprise that pictures play a vital role in doing it well.","J. W. Tukey & P. Tukey (1965)"
242,"Data visualization","Pictures","There is nothing better than a picture for making you think of questions you had forgotten to ask (even mentally).","J. W. Tukey & P. Tukey (1965)"
243,"Data visualization","Pictures","Functional visualizations are more than innovative statistical analyses and computational algorithms. They must make sense to the user and require a visual language system that uses colour, shape, line, hierarchy and composition to communicate clearly and appropriately, much like the alphabetic and character-based languages used worldwide between humans.","Matt Woolman, Digital Information Graphics"

248,"Data visualization","Geometry","Every measurable thing, except numbers, is imagined in the manner of continuous quantity. Therefore, for the mensuration of such a thing, it is necessary that points, lines and surfaces, or their properties be imagined. For in them, as the Philosopher has it, measure or ratio is initially found, while in other things it is recognized by similarity as they are being referred to by the intellect to the geometrical entities.","Nicole Oresme, The Latitude of Forms"
249,"Computing","","Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.","John von Neumann"
