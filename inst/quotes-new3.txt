## Science
It is strange that only extraordinary men make the discoveries, which later appear so easy and simple.
--- Georg C. Lichtenberg

% Georg Lichtenberg (1742 - 1799) was a German experimental physicist known for satire.
% Science is built upon previous knowledge, which is incredible that what is now common sense mathematics was once never before discovered or thought of.

Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
--- Albert Einstein

% This quote, first appearing in Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: a Revision of Freud's Theory and Method by Frederick S. Perls. Einstein (1879 - 1955) is known to have clashed with popular thinking and the limited imagination of fellow scientists and the public.

"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother."
--- Albert Einsten

Facts, however numerous, do not constitute a science. Like innumerable grains of sand on the sea shore, single facts appear isolated, useless, shapeless; it is only when compared, when arranged in their natural relations, when crystallised by the intellect, that they constitute the eternal truths of science
--- William Farr, "Observation," Br. Ann. Med. 1 (1837): 693

## Computing

Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way

## Data

We cannot understand the world without numbers, and we cannot understand it with numbers alone.
--- Hans Rosling

Bad data makes bad models. Bad models instruct people to make ineffective or harmful interventions. Those bad interventions produce more bad data, which is fed into more bad models.

Whenever I am infuriated, I revenge myself with a new Diagram
--- Florence Nightingale, Letter 1857.8.19 to Sidney Herbert

## Statistics

Statistics is the art of stating in precise terms that which one does not know.
--- William Kruskal

Again I must repeat my objections to intermingling causation with statistics. It might be to a certain extent admissible if you had no sanitary head. But you have one, & his report should be quite separate. The statistician has nothing to do with causation: he is almost certain in the present state of knowledge to err.
--- Florence Nightingale, Letter, March 1861


A Bayesian is one who, vaguely expecting a horse, and catching a glimpse of a donkey, strongly believes he has seen a mule.
--- Stephen John Senn @stephensenn

What nature hath joined together, multiple regression cannot put asunder.
--- Richard Nisbett
