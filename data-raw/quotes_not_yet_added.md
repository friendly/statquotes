Averages are like the economic man; they are inventions, not real. When applied to salaries they hide gaunt poverty at the lower end. (Julia Lathrop, 1919)


Statistics may be defined as numerical statements of facts by means of which large aggregates are analyzed, the relations of individual units to their groups are ascertained, comparisons are made between groups, and continuous records are maintained for comparative purposes. (Melvin T Copeland. Statistical Methods [in: Harvard Business Studies, Vol. III, Ed. by Melvin T Copeland, 1917])

"Starting from statistical observations, it is possible to arrive at conclusions which not less reliable or useful than those obtained in any other exact science. It is only necessary to apply a clear and precise concept of probability to such observations. " (Richard von Mises, "Probability, Statistics, and Truth", 1939)

"A random sequence is a vague notion embodying the idea of a sequence in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians and depending somewhat on the uses to which the sequence is to be put." (Derrick H Lehmer, 1951)

"To say that observations of the past are certain, whereas predictions are merely probable, is not the ultimate answer to the question of induction; it is only a sort of intermediate answer, which is incomplete unless a theory of probability is developed that explains what we should mean by ‘probable’ and on what ground we can assert probabilities." (Hans Reichenbach, "The Rise of Scientific Philosophy", 1951)

"All predictions are statistical, but some predictions have such a high probability that one tends to regard them as certain." (Marshall J Walker, "The Nature of Scientific Thought", 1963)

Statistics is the branch of scientific method which deals with the data obtained by counting or measuring the properties of populations of natural phenomena. (Sir Maurice G Kendall & Alan Stuart, The Advanced Theory of Statistics, 1963)

Statistics may be defined as the discipline concerned with the treatment of numerical data derived from groups of individuals. (Peter Armitage, Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 1971)

"No matter how much reverence is paid to anything purporting to be ‘statistics’, the term has no meaning unless the source, relevance, and truth are all checked." (Tom Burnam, "The Dictionary of Misinformation", 1975)

"The moment you forecast you know you’re going to be wrong, you just don’t know when and in which direction." (Edgar R Fiedler, "Across the Board", 1977)

Statistics is a tool. In experimental science you plan and carry out experiments, and then analyse and interpret the results. To do this you use statistical arguments and calculations. Like any other tool - an oscilloscope, for example, or a spectrometer, or even a humble spanner - you can use it delicately or clumsily, skillfully or ineptly. The more you know about it and understand how it works, the better you will be able to use it and the more useful it will be. (Roger Barlow, Statistics: A Guide to the Use of Statistical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 1989)

"Statistics at its best provides methodology for dealing empirically with complicated and uncertain information, in a way that is both useful and scientifically valid" (John M Chambers, 1993)

"[…] it does not seem helpful just to say that all models are wrong. The very word model implies simplification and idealization. The idea that complex physical, biological or sociological systems can be exactly described by a few formulae is patently absurd. The construction of idealized representations that capture important stable aspects of such systems is, however, a vital part of general scientific analysis and statistical models, especially substantive ones, do not seem essentially different from other kinds of model." (Sir David Cox, "Comment on ‘Model uncertainty, data mining and statistical inference’", Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A 158, 1995)

The science of statistics may be described as exploring, analyzing and summarizing data; designing or choosing appropriate ways of collecting data and extracting information from them; and communicating that information. Statistics also involves constructing and testing models for describing chance phenomena. These models can be used as a basis for making inferences and drawing conclusions and, finally, perhaps for making decisions. (Fergus Daly et al, Elements of Statistics, 1995)

Statistics is a general intellectual method that applies wherever data, variation, and chance appear. It is a fundamental method because data, variation and chance are omnipresent in modern life. It is an independent discipline with its own core ideas rather than, for example, a branch of mathematics. […] Statistics offers general, fundamental, and independent ways of thinking. (David S Moore, Statistics among the Liberal Arts, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1998)

"If a man stands with his left foot on a hot stove and his right foot in a refrigerator, the statistician would say that, on the average, he’s comfortable." (Walter Heller)



Put simply, statistics is a range of procedures for gathering, organizing, analyzing and presenting quantitative data. […] Essentially […], statistics is a scientific approach to analyzing numerical data in order to enable us to maximize our interpretation, understanding and use. This means that statistics helps us turn data into information; that is, data that have been interpreted, understood and are useful to the recipient. Put formally, for your project, statistics is the systematic collection and analysis of numerical data, in order to investigate or discover relationships among phenomena so as to explain, predict and control their occurrence. (Reva B Brown & Mark Saunders, Dealing with Statistics: What You Need to Know, 2008)


"Statistics is a very powerful and persuasive mathematical tool. People put a lot of faith in printed numbers. It seems when a situation is described by assigning it a numerical value, the validity of the report increases in the mind of the viewer. It is the statistician's obligation to be aware that data in the eyes of the uninformed or poor data in the eyes of the naive viewer can be as deceptive as any falsehoods." (Theoni Pappas, "More Joy of Mathematics: Exploring mathematical insights & concepts", 1991)

"Things are changing. Statisticians now recognize that computer scientists are making novel contributions while computer scientists now recognize the generality of statistical theory and methodology. Clever data mining algorithms are more scalable than statisticians ever thought possible. Formal statistical theory is more pervasive than computer scientists had realized." (Larry A Wasserman, "All of Statistics: A concise course in statistical inference", 2004)

"One feature [...] which requires much more justification than is usually given, is the setting up of unplausible null hypotheses. For example, a statistician may set out a test to see whether two drugs have exactly the same effect, or whether a regression line is exactly straight. These hypotheses can scarcely be taken literally." (Cedric A B Smith, "Book review of Norman T. J. Bailey: Statistical Methods in Biology", Applied Statistics 9, 1960)

"In general, it is necessary to have some data on which to calculate probabilities.[...] Statisticians do not evolve probabilities out of their inner consciousness, they merely calculate them." (Leonard C Tippett)


The enthusiastic use of statistics to prove one side of a case is not open to criticism providing the work is honestly and accurately done, and providing the conclusions are not broader than indicated by the data. This type of work must not be confused with the unfair and dishonest use of both accurate and inaccurate data, which too commonly occurs in business. Dishonest statistical work usually takes the form of: (1) deliberate misinterpretation of data; (2) intentional making of overestimates or underestimates; and (3) biasing results by using partial data, making biased surveys, or using wrong statistical methods. (John R Riggleman & Ira N Frisbee, Business Statistics, 1951)

Even properly done statistics can’t be trusted. The plethora of available statistical techniques and analyses grants researchers an enormous amount of freedom when analyzing their data, and it is trivially easy to ‘torture the data until it confesses’. (Alex Reinhart, Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide, 2015)


"We realize that if someone just 'grabs a handful', the individuals in the handful almost always resemble one another (on the average) more than do the members of a simple random sample. Even if the 'grabs' [sampling] are randomly spread around so that every individual has an equal chance of entering the sample, there are difficulties. Since the individuals of grab samples resemble one another more than do individuals of random samples, it follows (by a simple mathematical argument) that the means of grab samples resemble one another less than the means of random samples of the same size. From a grab sample, therefore, we tend to underestimate the variability in the population, although we should have to overestimate it in order to obtain valid estimates of variability of grab sample means by substituting such an estimate into the formula for the variability of means of simple random samples. Thus using simple random sample formulas for grab sample means introduces a double bias, both parts of which lead to an unwarranted appearance of higher stability." (Frederick Mosteller et al, "Principles of Sampling", Journal of the American Statistical Association Vol. 49 (265), 1954)

"Using data from the population as it stands is a dangerous substitute for testing." (Frederick Mosteller & Gale Mosteller, "New Statistical Methods in Public Policy. Part I: Experimentation", Journal of Contemporary Business 8, 1979)

"The closer that sample-selection procedures approach the gold standard of random selection - for which the definition is that every individual in the population has an equal chance of appearing in the sample - the more we should trust them. If we don’t know whether a sample is random, any statistical measure we conduct may be biased in some unknown way." (Richard E Nisbett, "Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking", 2015)

"A popular misconception holds that the era of Big Data means the end of a need for sampling. In fact, the proliferation of data of varying quality and relevance reinforces the need for sampling as a tool to work efficiently with a variety of data, and minimize bias. Even in a Big Data project, predictive models are typically developed and piloted with samples." (Peter C Bruce & Andrew G Bruce, "Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts", 2016)

Can there be laws of chance? The answer, it would seem should be negative, since chance is in fact defined as the characteristic of the phenomena which follow no law, phenomena whose causes are too complex to permit prediction. (Félix E Borel, Probabilities and Life, 1962)

All predictions are statistical, but some predictions have such a high probability that one tends to regard them as certain. (Marshall J Walker, The Nature of Scientific Thought, 1963)


Statistics is a scientific discipline concerned with collection, analysis, and interpretation of data obtained from observation or experiment. The subject has a coherent structure based on the theory of Probability and includes many different procedures which contribute to research and development throughout the whole of Science and Technology. (Egon Pearson, 1936)

[Statistics] is both a science and an art. It is a science in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application; and an art in that their successful application depends to a considerable degree on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application, e.g. economics. (Leonard H C Tippett, Statistics, 1943)

"Statistics is the branch of scientific method which deals with the data obtained by counting or measuring the properties of populations of natural phenomena. In this definition 'natural phenomena' includes all the happenings of the external world, whether human or not " (Sir Maurice G Kendall, Advanced Theory of Statistics, Vol. 1, 1943)

There are two aspects of statistics that are continually mixed, the method and the science. Statistics are used as a method, whenever we measure something, for example, the size of a district, the number of inhabitants of a country, the quantity or price of certain commodities, etc. […] There is, moreover, a science of statistics. It consists of knowing how to gather numbers, combine them and calculate them, in the best way to lead to certain results. But this is, strictly speaking, a branch of mathematics." (Alphonse P de Candolle, Considerations on Crime Statistics, 1833)


"The fact must be expressed as data, but there is a problem in that the correct data is difficult to catch. So that I always say 'When you see the data, doubt it!' 'When you see the measurement instrument, doubt it!' [...]For example, if the methods such as sampling, measurement, testing and chemical analysis methods were incorrect, data. […] to measure true characteristics and in an unavoidable case, using statistical sensory test and express them as data." (Kaoru Ishikawa, Annual Quality Congress Transactions, 1981)

"There is a tendency to mistake data for wisdom, just as there has always been a tendency to confuse logic with values, intelligence with insight. Unobstructed access to facts can produce unlimited good only if it is matched by the desire and ability to find out what they mean and where they lead." (Norman Cousins, "Human Options : An Autobiographical Notebook", 1981)

"A scientist should not cheat or falsify data or quote out of context or do any other thing that is intellectually dishonest. Of course, as always, some individuals fail; but science as a whole disapproves of such action. Indeed, when transgressors are detected, they are usually expelled from the community." (Michael Ruse, "Response to the Commentary: Pro Judice", Science, Technology and Human Values Vol. 7 (41), 1982)


"Data in isolation are meaningless, a collection of numbers. Only in context of a theory do they assume significance […]" (George Greenstein, "Frozen Star", 1983)

There are those who try to generalize, synthesize, and build models, and there are those who believe nothing and constantly call for more data. The tension between these two groups is a healthy one; science develops mainly because of the model builders, yet they need the second group to keep them honest. (Andrew Miall, Principles of Sedimentary Basin Analysis, 1984)

"Data is raw. It simply exists and has no significance beyond its existence (in and of itself). It can exist in any form, usable or not. It does not have meaning of itself. In computer parlance, a spreadsheet generally starts out by holding data." (Russell L Ackoff, "Towards a Systems Theory of Organization, 1985)


"Intuition becomes increasingly valuable in the new information society precisely because there is so much data." (John Naisbitt, "Re-Inventing the Corporation", 1985)

"Thus statistics should generally be taught more as a practical subject with analyses of real data. Of course some theory and an appropriate range of statistical tools need to be learnt, but students should be taught that Statistics is much more than a collection of standard prescriptions." (Christopher Chatfield, "The Initial Examination of Data", Journal of the Royal Statistical Society A Vol. 148, 1985)

"Models are often used to decide issues in situations marked by uncertainty. However statistical differences from data depend on assumptions about the process which generated these data. If the assumptions do not hold, the inferences may not be reliable either. This limitation is often ignored by applied workers who fail to identify crucial assumptions or subject them to any kind of empirical testing. In such circumstances, using statistical procedures may only compound the uncertainty." (David A Greedman & William C Navidi, "Regression Models for Adjusting the 1980 Census", Statistical Science Vol. 1 (1), 1986)


"[...] to acknowledge the subjectivity inherent in the interpretation of data is to recognize the central role of statistical analysis as a formal mechanism by which new evidence can be integrated with existing knowledge. Such a view of statistics as a dynamic discipline is far from the common perception of a rather dry, automatic technology for processing data." (Donald A Berry, "Statistical Analysis and the Illusion of Objectivity", American Scientist Vol. 76, 1988)

"Randomness is a difficult notion for people to accept. When events come in clusters and streaks, people look for explanations and patterns. They refuse to believe that such patterns - which frequently occur in random data - could equally well be derived from tossing a coin. So it is in the stock market as well." (Burton G Malkiel, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street", 1989)

"When evaluating a model, at least two broad standards are relevant. One is whether the model is consistent with the data. The other is whether the model is consistent with the ‘real world’." (Kenneth A Bollen, "Structural Equations with Latent Variables", 1989)


"Data is transformed into graphics to understand. A map, a diagram are documents to be interrogated. But understanding means integrating all of the data. In order to do this it’s necessary to reduce it to a small number of elementary data. This is the objective of the 'data treatment' be it graphic or mathematic." (Jacques Bertin, [interview] 2003)

"Graphical design notations have been with us for a while [...] their primary value is in communication and understanding. A good diagram can often help communicate ideas about a design, particularly when you want to avoid a lot of details. Diagrams can also help you understand either a software system or a business process. As part of a team trying to figure out something, diagrams both help understanding and communicate that understanding throughout a team. Although they aren't, at least yet, a replacement for textual programming languages, they are a helpful assistant." (Martin Fowler," UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling", 2004)

"A diagram is a graphic shorthand. Though it is an ideogram, it is not necessarily an abstraction. It is a representation of something in that it is not the thing itself. In this sense, it cannot help but be embodied. It can never be free of value or meaning, even when it attempts to express relationships of formation and their processes. At the same time, a diagram is neither a structure nor an abstraction of structure." (Peter Eisenman, "Written Into the Void: Selected Writings", 1990-2004, 2007)


"The aim of the graphic is to make the relationship among previously defined sets appear." (Jacques Bertin, Semiology of graphics [Semiologie Graphique], 1967)


"As with any graphic, networks are used in order to discover pertinent troups of to inform others of the groups and structures discovered. It is a good means of displaying structures, However, it ceases to be a means of discovery when the elements are numerous. The ﬁgure rapidly becomes complex, illegible and untransformable." (Jacques Bertin, Graphics and graphic information processing, 1977)


One can be highly functionally numerate without being a mathematician or a quantitative analyst. It is not the mathematical manipulation of numbers (or symbols representing numbers) that is central to the notion of numeracy. Rather, it is the ability to draw correct meaning from a logical argument couched in numbers. When such a logical argument relates to events in our uncertain real world, the element of uncertainty makes it, in fact, a statistical argument. (Eric R Sowey, The Getting of Wisdom: Educating Statisticians to Enhance Their Clients' Numeracy, The American Statistician 57(2), 2003)

Statistical literacy is more than numeracy. It includes the ability to read and communicate the meaning of data. This quality makes people literate as opposed to just numerate. Wherever words (and pictures) are added to numbers and data in your communication, people need to be able to understand them correctly. (United Nations, Making Data Meaningful Part 4: A guide to improving statistical literacy, 2012)


We would wish ‘numerate’ to imply the possession of two attributes. The first of these is an ‘at-homeness’ with numbers and an ability to make use of mathematical skills which enable an individual to cope with the practical mathematical demands of his everyday life. The second is ability to have some appreciation and understanding of information which is presented in mathematical terms, for instance in graphs, charts or tables or by reference to percentage increase or decrease. (Cockcroft Committee, Mathematics Counts: A Report into the Teaching of Mathematics in Schools, 1982)


[…] data analysis in the context of basic mathematical concepts and skills. The ability to use and interpret simple graphical and numerical descriptions of data is the foundation of numeracy […] Meaningful data aid in replacing an emphasis on calculation by the exercise of judgement and a stress on interpreting and communicating results. (David S Moore, Statistics for All: Why, What and How?, 1990)

We believe that numeracy is about making meaning in mathematics and being critical about maths. This view of numeracy is very different from numeracy just being about numbers, and it is a big step from numeracy or everyday maths that meant doing some functional maths. It is about using mathematics in all its guises - space and shape, measurement, data and statistics, algebra, and of course, number - to make sense of the real world, and using maths critically and being critical of maths itself. It acknowledges that numeracy is a social activity. That is why we can say that numeracy is not less than maths but more. It is why we don’t need to call it critical numeracy being numerate is being critical. (Dave Tout & Beth Marr, Changing practice: Adult numeracy professional development, 1997)


"The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, nor the beauty or elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models." (Lawrence M Krauss, "A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing", 2012)

"One good experiment is worth a thousand models […]; but one good model can make a thousand experiments unnecessary." (David Lloyd & Evgenii I Volkov,"The Ultradian Clock: Timekeeping for Intracelular Dynamics" [in"Complexity, Chaos, and Biological Evolution", Ed. by Erik Mosekilde & Lis Mosekilde, 2013)


"How do you know when a correlation indicates causation? One way is to conduct a controlled experiment. Another is to apply logic. But be careful - it’s easy to get bogged down in semantics." (Daniel J Levitin, "Weaponized Lies", 2017)


"Some people derive satisfaction from accumulating data, whereas others are content to dream and leave experiments to colleagues. Still others flit from flower to flower rather than learning more and more about one situation. The difference in approach is a matter of temperament, and we all must understand our own strengths. All workers ultimately contribute to the matrix of facts, ideas, understandings, techniques, and visions that we know as science." (Arthur J Birch, "To See the Obvious", 1995)

"[...] the definitive property of good theory is predictiveness. Those theories endure that are precise in the predictions they make across many phenomena and whose predictions are easiest to test by observation and experiment." (Edward O Wilson, "Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge", 1998)


"In all scientific fields, theory is frequently more important than experimental data. Scientists are generally reluctant to accept the existence of a phenomenon when they do not know how to explain it. On the other hand, they will often accept a theory that is especially plausible before there exists any data to support it." (Richard Morris, 1983)


"A first analysis of experimental results should, I believe, invariably be conducted using flexible data analytical techniques - looking at graphs and simple statistics - that so far as possible allow the data to 'speak for themselves'. The unexpected phenomena that such a approach often uncovers can be of the greatest importance in shaping and sometimes redirecting the course of an ongoing investigation." (George Box, "Signal to Noise Ratios, Performance Criteria, and Transformations", Technometrics 30, 1988)


"Some methods, such as those governing the design of experiments or the statistical treatment of data, can be written down and studied. But many methods are learned only through personal experience and interactions with other scientists. Some are even harder to describe or teach. Many of the intangible influences on scientific discovery - curiosity, intuition, creativity - largely defy rational analysis, yet they are often the tools that scientists bring to their work." (Committee on the Conduct of Science, "On Being a Scientist", 1989)



"In moving from conjecture to experimental data, (D), experiments must be designed which make best use of the experimenter's current state of knowledge and which best illuminate his conjecture. In moving from data to modified conjecture, (A), data must be analyzed so as to accurately present information in a manner which is readily understood by the experimenter." (George E P Box & George C Tjao, "Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis", 1973)

"An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or the other." (Robert M Pirsig, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", 1974)

"A hypothesis is empirical or scientific only if it can be tested by experience. […] A hypothesis or theory which cannot be, at least in principle, falsified by empirical observations and experiments does not belong to the realm of science." (Francisco J Ayala, "Biological Evolution: Natural Selection or Random Walk", American Scientist, 1974)



"We know the laws of trial and error, of large numbers and probabilities. We know that these laws are part of the mathematical and mechanical fabric of the universe, and that they are also at play in biological processes. But, in the name of the experimental method and out of our poor knowledge, are we really entitled to claim that everything happens by chance, to the exclusion of all other possibilities?" (Albert Claude, "The Coming Age of the Cell", Nobel Prize Lecture] 1974)

"Of course, we know the laws of trial and error, of large numbers and probabilities. We know that these laws are part of the mathematical and mechanical fabric of the universe, and that they are also at play in biological processes. But, in the name of the experimental method and out of our poor knowledge, are we really entitled to claim that everything happens by chance, to the exclusion of all other possibilities?" (Albert Claude,"The Coming of Age of the Cell", Science, 1975)


"We must start with scientific fundamentals, and that means with the data of experiments and not with assumed axioms predicated only upon the misleading nature of that which only superficially seems to be obvious. It is the consensus of great scientists that science is the attempt to set in order the facts of experience." (R Buckminster Fuller, "Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking", 1975)

"It is argued that principle of causality is fundamental to human thinking, and it has been observed experimentally that this assumption leads to complex hypothesis formation by human subjects attempting to solve comparatively simple problems involving a causal randomly generated events." (Brian R Gaines, "On the Complexity of Causal Models", Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 1976)

"The essential function of a hypothesis consists in the guidance it affords to new observations and experiments, by which our conjecture is either confirmed or refuted." (Ernst Mach, "Knowledge and Error: Sketches on the Psychology of Enquiry", 1976)


"The interpretation of a scientific experiment should not be extended beyond the limits of the available data. In the building of theories, however, scientists propose general principles by extrapolation beyond available data. When former theories have been shown to be inadequate, scientists    should be prepared to relinquish the old and embrace the new in their never-ending search for better solutions. It is unscientific, therefore, to claim to have 'proof of the truth' when all that scientific methodology can provide is evidence in support of a theory." (William D Stansfield, "The Science of Evolution", 1977)



"When evaluating the reliability and generality of data, it is often important to know the aims of the experimenter. When evaluating the importance of experimental results, however, science has a trick of disregarding the experimenter's rationale and finding a more appropriate context for the data than the one he proposed." (Murray Sidman, "Tactics of Scientific Research", 1960)



"[…] no one believes an hypothesis except its originator but everyone believes an experiment except the experimenter." (William I B Beveridge, "The Art of Scientific Investigation", 1950)

"The hypothesis is the principal intellectual instrument in research. Its function is to indicate new experiments and observations and it therefore sometimes leads to discoveries even when not correct itself. We must resist the temptation to become too attached to our hypothesis, and strive to judge it objectively and modify it or discard it as soon as contrary evidence is brought to light. Vigilance is needed to prevent our observations and interpretations being biased in favor of the hypothesis. Suppositions can be used without being believed." (William I B Beveridge, "The Art of Scientific Investigation", 1950)


"A satisfactory prediction of the sequential properties of learning data from a single experiment is by no means a final test of a model. Numerous other criteria - and some more demanding - can be specified. For example, a model with specific numerical parameter values should be invariant to changes in independent variables that explicitly enter in the model." (Robert R Bush & Frederick Mosteller,"A Comparison of Eight Models?", Studies in Mathematical Learning Theory, 1959)


"Experiments are like cross-questioning a witness who will tell the truth but not the whole truth." (Alan Gregg, "The Furtherance of Medical Research", 1941)

"The question of the origin of the hypothesis belongs to a domain in which no very general rules can be given; experiment, analogy and constructive intuition play their part here. But once the correct hypothesis is formulated, the principle of mathematical induction is often sufficient to provide the proof." (Richard Courant & Herbert Robbins, "What Is Mathematics?", 1941)



"Statistics is a scientific discipline concerned with collection, analysis, and interpretation of data obtained from observation or experiment. The subject has a coherent structure based on the theory of Probability and includes many different procedures which contribute to research and development throughout the whole of Science and Technology." (Egon Pearson, 1936)



"To find out what happens to a system when you interfere with it you have to interfere with it (not just passively observe it)." (George E P Box, "Use and Abuse of Regression", 1966)


"In moving from conjecture to experimental data, (D), experiments must be designed which make best use of the experimenter's current state of knowledge and which best illuminate his conjecture. In moving from data to modified conjecture, (A), data must be analyzed so as to accurately present information in a manner which is readily understood by the experimenter." (George E P Box & George C Tjao, "Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis", 1973)

"Statistical methods are tools of scientific investigation. Scientific investigation is a controlled learning process in which various aspects of a problem are illuminated as the study proceeds. It can be thought of as a major iteration within which secondary iterations occur. The major iteration is that in which a tentative conjecture suggests an experiment, appropriate analysis of the data so generated leads to a modified conjecture, and this in turn leads to a new experiment, and so on." (George E P Box & George C Tjao, "Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis", 1973)



Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a ‘correct’ one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity. (George E P Box, Science and Statistics", Journal of the American Statistical Association 71, 1976)

"Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad." (George E P Box, "Science and Statistics", Journal of the American Statistical Association 71, 1976)


The fact that [the model] is an approximation does not necessarily detract from its usefulness because models are approximations. All models are wrong, but some are useful. (George E P Box, 1987)

"Statistics is, or should be, about scientific investigation and how to do it better, but many statisticians believe it is a branch of mathematics." (George E P Box, Commentary, Technometrics 32, 1990)


"Scientific method is concerned with efficient ways of generating knowledge." (George E P Box, "Total Quality: Its Origins and its Future", 1995)
"The central limit theorem says that, under conditions almost always satisfied in the real world of experimentation, the distribution of such a linear function of errors will tend to normality as the number of its components becomes large. The tendency to normality occurs almost regardless of the individual distributions of the component errors. An important proviso is that several sources of error must make important contributions to the overall error and that no particular source of error dominate the rest." (George E P Box et al, "Statistics for Experimenters: Design, discovery, and innovation" 2nd Ed., 2005)

"Two things explain the importance of the normal distribution: (1) The central limit effect that produces a tendency for real error distributions to be 'normal like'. (2) The robustness to nonnormality of some common statistical procedures, where 'robustness' means insensitivity to deviations from theoretical normality." (George E P Box et al, "Statistics for Experimenters: Design, discovery, and innovation" 2nd Ed., 2005)
"All models are approximations. Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind." (George E P Box & Norman R Draper, "Response Surfaces, Mixtures, and Ridge Analyses", 2007)


"The preliminary examination of most data is facilitated by the use of diagrams. Diagrams prove nothing, but bring outstanding features readily to the eye; they are therefore no substitutes for such critical tests as may be applied to the data, but are valuable in suggesting such tests, and in explaining the conclusions founded upon them." (Sir Ronald A Fisher, "Statistical Methods for Research Workers", 1925)



"[…] no isolated experiment, however significant in itself, can suffice for the experimental demonstration of any natural phenomenon; for the ‘one chance in a million’ will undoubtedly occur, with no less and no more than its appropriate frequency, however surprised we may be that it should occur to us." (Sir Ronald A Fisher, "The Design of Experiments", 1971)



"From the moment we first roll a die in a children's board game, or pick a card (any card), we start to learn what probability is. But even as adults, it is not easy to tell what it is, in the general way." (David Stirzaker, "Probability and Random Variables: A Beginner's Guide", 1999)


"The whole point of probability is to discuss uncertain eventualities before they occur. After this event, things are completely different." (David Stirzaker, "Probability and Random Variables: A Beginner's Guide", 1999)

"We cannot really have a perfectly shuffled pack of perfect cards; this 'collection of equally likely hands' is actually a fiction. We create the idea, and then use the rules of arithmetic to calculate the required chances. This is characteristic of all mathematics, which concerns itself only with rules defining the behaviour of entities which are themselves undefined (such as 'numbers' or 'points')." (David Stirzaker, "Probability and Random Variables: A Beginner's Guide", 1999)


"There is no such thing as randomness. No one who could detect every force operating on a pair of dice would ever play dice games, because there would never be any doubt about the outcome. The randomness, such as it is, applies to our ignorance of the possible outcomes. It doesn’t apply to the outcomes themselves. They are 100% determined and are not random in the slightest. Scientists have become so confused by this that they now imagine that things really do happen randomly, i.e. for no reason at all." (Thomas Stark, "God Is Mathematics: The Proofs of the Eternal Existence of Mathematics", 2018)



"Why is the human need to be in control relevant to a discussion of random patterns? Because if events are random, we are not in control, and if we are in control of events, they are not random. There is therefore a fundamental clash between our need to feel we are in control and our ability to recognize randomness. That clash is one of the principal reasons we misinterpret random events."  (Leonard Mlodinow, "The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives", 2008)

"The postulate of randomness thus resolves itself into the question, 'of what population is this a random sample?' which must frequently be asked by every practical statistician." (Ronald Fisher, "On the Mathematical Foundation of Theoretical Statistics", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Vol. A222, 1922)


"Statistics has been likened to a telescope. The latter enables one to see further and to make clear objects which were diminished or obscured by distance. The former enables one to discern structure and relationships which were distorted by other factors or obscured by random variation." (David J Hand, "The Role of Statistics in Psychiatry", Psychological Medicine Vol. 15, 1985)


"When looking at the end result of any statistical analysis, one must be very cautious not to over interpret the data. Care must be taken to know the size of the sample, and to be certain the method for gathering information is consistent with other samples gathered. […] No one should ever base conclusions without knowing the size of the sample and how random a sample it was. But all too often such data is not mentioned when the statistics are given - perhaps it is overlooked or even intentionally omitted." (Theoni Pappas, "More Joy of Mathematics: Exploring mathematical insights & concepts", 1994)


"An extremely odd demand is often set forth but never met, even by those who make it; i.e., that empirical data should be presented without any theoretical context, leaving the reader, the student, to his own devices in judging it. This demand seems odd because it is useless simply to look at something. Every act of looking turns into observation, every act of observation into reflection, every act of reflection into the making of associations; thus it is evident that we theorize every time we look carefully at the world." (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)
