quo:The physical sciences are used to 'praying over' their data, examining the same data from a variety of points of view. This process has been very rewarding, and has led to many extremely valuable insights. Without this sort of flexibility, progress in physical science would have been much slower. Flexibility in analysis is often to be had honestly at the price of a willingness not to demand that what has already been observed shall establish, or prove, what analysis suggests. In physical science generally, the results of praying over the data are thought of as something to be put to further test in another experiment, as indications rather than conclusions.

quo:If one technique of data analysis were to be exalted above all others for its ability to be revealing to the mind in connection with each of many different models, there is little doubt which one would be chosen. The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device. It specializes in providing indications of unexpected phenomena.

quo:Around the turn of the century, Karl Pearson, an almost elemental force for more and better statistical thought in all areas of life, including with gusto, matters of social policy, was thinking and lecturing about graphical methods. But later in Pearson's life, and certainly in the careers of R. A. Fisher and the other great statistical minds of the first half of the century, there was a falling away of interest in graphics and an efflorescence  of devotion to analytical mathematical methods. Indeed, for many years there was a contagious *snobbery* against so unpopular, vulgar and elementary a topic as graphics among academic statisticians and their students

quo:Mr. Funkhouser has made an extremely interesting and valuable contribution to the history of statistical method. I wish, however, that he could have added a warning, supported by horrid examples, of the evils of the graphical method unsupported by tables of  figures. Both for  accurate understanding, and particularly to facilitate the use of the same material by other people, it is essential that graphs should not be published by themselves, but only when supported by the tables which lead up to them. It would be an exceedingly good rule to forbid in any scientific periodical the publication of graphs unsupported by tables.

The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason.

quo:In scientific thought we adopt the simplest theory which will explain all the facts under consideration and enable us to predict new facts of the same kind. The catch in this criterion lies in the world "simplest." It is really an aesthetic canon such as we find implicit in our criticisms of poetry or painting. The layman finds such a law as dx/dt = K(d^2x/dy^2) much less simple than "it oozes," of which it is the mathematical statement. The physicist reverses this judgment, and his statement is certainly the more fruitful of the two, so far as prediction is concerned. It is, however, a statement about something very unfamiliar to the plainman, namely, the rate of change of a rate of change.

At first this seemed to be a move away from S altogether: something called the "Quantitative Programming Environment" was initially a separate research project, aimed more explicitly at programming and trying to emphasize that users need not be statistically sophisticated. By 1986, however, the decision was made to merge this work with the facilities (especially the graphics) underlying S, to produce a new version of S. (This explains, by the way, why the main program for S is called Sqpe, another one of those little puzzles for users.)

Nowhere is it written on a stone tablet what kind of model should be used to solve problems involving data. To make my position clear, I am not against models per se. In some situations they are the most appropriate way to solve the problem. But the emphasis needs to be on the problem and on the data. Unfortunately, our field has a vested interest in models, come hell or high water. For instance, see Dempster's (1998) paper on modelling. His position on the 1990 Census adjustment controversy is particularly interesting. He admits that he doesn't know much about the data or the details, but argues that the problem can be solved by a strong dose of modelling. That more modeling can make error-ridden data accurate seems highly unlikely to me.

The papers I have read on using residual analysis to check lack of fit are confined to data sets with two or three variables. With higher dimensions, the interactions between the variables can produce passable residual plots for a variety of models. A residual plot is a goodness-of-fit test, and lacks power in more than a few dimensions. An acceptable residual plot does not imply that the model is a good fit to the data.

From the perspective of the applied data analyst, R packages without procedures to compute quantities of scientific interest are woefully incomplete.  A better approach focuses on quantities of direct scientific interest rather than uninterpretable model parameters. ... For each quantity of interest, the user needs some summary that includes a point estimate and a measure of uncertainty such as a standard error, confidence interval, or a distribution.  The methods of calculating these differ greatly across theories of inference and methods of analysis.  However, from the user's perspective, the result is almost always the same: the point estimate and uncertainty of some quantity of interest.

quo:It's not easy to select more than a few clearly distinct colors. Also, "distinct" is context-dependent, because: What will be the spatial relationships of the different colors in your output? You can successfully have fairly similar colors adjacent to each other, since the contrast is more obvious when they're adjacent. However, if you want to use colors to track identity and difference across scattered points or patches, then you need bigger separations between colors, since you want to be able to see easily that patch "A" here is of the same kind as patch "A" there and different from patch "B" somewhere else, when mingled with patches of other kinds. And size matters. Big patches of similar color (as on a map) can look quite distinct, while the same colors used to plot filled circular blobs on a graph might be barely distinguishable, and totally indistinguishable if used to plot colored "."s or "+"s. It depends too on what you will be using to render the colors. Monitor screens vary in their ability to render different colors distinctly, and so do color printers. It's all very psycho-visual and success usually requires experimentation!

quo:We thus echo the classical Bayesian literature in concluding that 'noninformative prior information' is a contradiction in terms.

Indeed, the signal-to-noise ratio s is often very low and then it is necessary to shrink the unbiased estimate. Failure to do so by inappropriately using the flat prior causes overestimation of effects and subsequent failure to replicate them.

But whether texts or instructors err in explaining them, students do not understand them. And they carry this misunderstanding with them into later life. Calculating a confidence interval is easy. But everyone except the cognoscenti believes that when one calculates 95% confidence limits of 2.6 and 7.9, say, the probability is 95% that the parameter in question lies in the interval from 2.6 to 7.9. P values are nearly as obscure as confidence intervals. Diamond and Forrester (1983) make it clear that MDs [Medical Doctors] do not understand P values (and in particular that they themselves do not understand P values!). Students in frequentist courses may learn very well how to calculate confidence intervals and P values, but they cannot give them correct interpretations. I stopped teaching frequentist methods when I decided that they could not be learned.

quo:Uniform priors on probabilities are ubiquitous. I agree that they can be useful. However, if the probability in question is the prevalence of HIV in California, it is ridiculous to assert that a prevalence of 100% is equally plausible with 0%, or that the chance that it is above 50% is the same as the chance that it is below 50%. It is particularly noxious to call such a prior noninformative. Instead, it is disinformative. The likelihood notwith standing, positing a uniform prior for the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow is equally ridiculous, given that we are all confident that it has risen all the days of our lives.

quo:In the design of experiments, one has to use some informal prior knowledge.  How does one construct blocks in a block design problem for instance?  It is stupid to think that use is not made of a prior.  But knowing that this prior is utterly casual, it seems ludicrous to go through a lot of integration, etc., to obtain 'exact' posterior probabilities resulting from this prior.  So, I believe the situation with respect to Bayesian inference and with respect to inference, in general, has not made progress.  Well, Bayesian statistics has led to a great deal of theoretical research.  But I don't see any real utilizations in applications, you know.  Now no one, as far as I know, has examined the question of whether the inferences that are obtained are, in fact, realized in the predictions that they are used to make.

For example, Bayesians identified which frequentist methods were "incoherent", or more accurately, lamented that none seemed to be coherent. On the other hand, Bayesians were accused of being "biased". The rhetoric was not all that different from that of the Fisher/Pearson duels. But we Bayesians have stopped saying derogatory things, partly because we have changed and partly because frequentists have been listening.

quo:An important distinction needs to be made between experimental designs using complete blocks and those using incomplete blocks as regards to three functions: 1. reducing the error mean square 2. adjusting estimates closer to true values, and  3. refining rankings. Complete blocks include all treatments whereas incomplete blocks include a subset of the treatments. Both can reduce the residual error, but only incomplete blocks can also adjust estimates of treatment effects closer to the true values and thereby refine rankings among the treatments. These adjusted estimates are usually more accurate than the raw averages over replicates, but not always (exactly as is the case for accuracy gain through more replication).  Likewise, these adjusted rankings are more likely to identify correctly the best treatments. By declaring a smaller error but doing nothing to sharpen estimates or refine rankings, complete block designs are rather impotent. It is ironic that scientists rarely understand this huge difference between getting one benefit or three from blocking.

Our thesis is that people have strong intuitions about random sampling; that these intuitions are wrong in fundamental respects; that these intuitions are shared by naive subjects and by trained scientists; and that they are applied with unfortunate consequences in the course of scientific inquiry. We submit that people view a sample randomly drawn from a population as highly representative, that is, similar to the population in all essential characteristics.  Consequently, they expect any two samples drawn from a particular population to be more similar to one another and to the population than sampling theory predicts, at least for small samples.

quo:Statistical hypothesis testing is commonly used inappropriately to analyze data, determine causality, and make decisions about significance in ecological risk assessment,... It discourages good toxicity testing and field studies, it provides less protection to ecosystems or their components that are difficult to sample or replicate, and it provides less protection when more treatments or responses are used. It provides a poor basis for decision-making because it does not generate a conclusion of no effect, it does not indicate the nature or magnitude of effects, it does address effects at untested exposure levels, and it confounds effects and uncertainty....

Now, let us reverse the question: What is the probability that a person has been hanged (H) given that the person is dead (D); that is, what is p(H|D)? This time the probability will undoubtedly be very low, perhaps .01 or lower. No one would be likely to make the mistake of substituting the first estimate (.97) for the second (.01); that is, to accept .97 as the probability that a person has been hanged given that the person is dead. Even thought this seems to be an unlikely mistake, it is exactly the kind of mistake that is made with the interpretation of statistical significance testing---by analogy, calculated estimates of p(H|D) are interpreted as if they were estimates of p(D|H), when they are clearly not the same.

quo:Data analysis methods in psychology still emphasize statistical significance testing, despite numerous articles demonstrating its severe deficiencies. It is now possible to use meta-analysis to show that reliance on significance testing retards the development of cumulative knowledge. The reform of teaching and practice will also require that researchers learn that the benefits that they believe flow from use of significance testing are illusory. Teachers must re-vamp their courses to bring students to understand that a) reliance on significance testing retards the growth of cumulative research knowledge; b) benefits widely believed to flow from significance testing do not in fact exist; c) significance testing methods must be replaced with point estimates and confidence intervals in individual studies and with meta-analyses and the integration of multiple studies. This reform is essential to the future progress of cumulative knowledge and psychological research.

quo:An important part of the explanation [of continued use of significance testing] is that researchers hold false beliefs about significance testing, beliefs that tell them that significance testing offers important benefits to researchers that it in fact does not. Three of these beliefs are particularly important. The first is the false belief that the significance level of a study indicates the probability of successful replications of the study.... A second false belief widely held by researchers is that statistical significance level provides an index of the importance or size of a difference or relation.... The third false belief held by many researchers is the most devastating of all to the research enterprise. This is the belief that if a difference or relation is not statistically significant, then it is zero, or at least so small that it can safely be considered to be zero. This is the belief that if the null hypothesis is not rejected then it is to be accepted. This is the belief that a major benefit from significance tests is that they tell us whether a difference or affect is real or 'probably just occurred by chance'.

quo:An observation is judged significant, if it would rarely have been produced, in the absence of a real cause of the kind we are seeking. It is a common practice to judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that it would have been produced by chance not more frequently than once in twenty trials. This is an arbitrary, but convenient, level of significance for the practical investigator, but it does not mean that he allows himself to be deceived once in every twenty experiments. The test of significance only tells him what to ignore, namely all experiments in which significant results are not obtained. He should only claim that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when he knows how to design an experiment so that it will rarely fail to give a significant result. Consequently, isolated significant results which he does not know how to reproduce are left in suspense pending further investigation.

quo: We had once advocated a change in wheat plot lengths from 2 chains to 3, based on results from uniformity trials. It seemed a very good idea until a biometrician went to help harvest a very good crop and found he had to lift and carry bags of over 100 pounds, this being the yield from each plot.

quo: Everyone who has carried out experiments in the field or farmyard must be well aware that the result of a single experiment is very often entirely misleading. Yet it is still common practice to publish single results and to base practical advice upon them.

quo: The preparation of clear and simple plans, and a convenient system of numbering the [treatments] that are to be applied, will lighten the work of the man in the field, who is usually operating under averse conditions, is frequently in a hurry, and is sometimes not very certain of the points at issue.

quo: I do not always agree with Sir Ronald Fisher, but it is due to him that the standard of presentation of results in agriculture is better than in any of the so-called exact sciencees; and this is a state of affairs that physicists should cease to tolerate.

quo: When [the profession of] statistics becomes clearly embedded in people's minds as being concerned with *investigation* rather than simply *calculation* (or worse still, mere cataloguing of data), there can be no room for doubts about the relevance of the subject.

quo: We have to teach non-statisticians to recognize where statistical expertise is required. No one else will. We teach students how to solve simple statistical problems, but how often do we make any serious effort to teach them to recognize situations that call for statistical expertise that is beyond the technical content of the course.=?

quo: The dominant feature of our 129 barley trials was the large differences...overy the five years of the study, even for the same field. To give sound advice on choice of plot size and shape, statisticians will require results from many trials conducted over many years, not to mention crops.
