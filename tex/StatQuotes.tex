\title{Quotes on Statistics, Data Visualization, and Science}
\author{Michael Friendly}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

%\begin{abstract}
This is a collection of quotations dealing with aspects of statistics, data visualization
and science I assembled over the years from various
sources.  I use them in books, articles and lectures to set some context
or to make a point. Maybe others will find them useful as collected here.
 
It began life as a simple text file and was later converted to
\LaTeX\  using the \texttt{epigraph} package to format them as nice
quotations for a chapter or section.  
The quotations are classified by general topics (and subtopics) as shown below; the placement
in these categories is an arbitrary choice to some degree.
In this listing, the formatting attributes of an \verb|\epigraph{text}{source}|
has been modified to conserve space.

The exact wording and the attribution (``source'') of quotations is often controversial, either for
the author or location.
The cited source given here is sometimes
supplemented by notes on my sources or further discussion.
A good place to track down problem quotations is \url{http://quoteinvestigator.com}.
