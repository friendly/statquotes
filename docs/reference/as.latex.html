In physical science generally, the results of praying over the data are thought of as something to be put to further test in another experiment, as indications rather than conclusions.}{John Tukey, The Future of Data Analysis, Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 1962, Vol. 33 (1), 1962.}\n\n"</span>
