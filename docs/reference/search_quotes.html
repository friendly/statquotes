#&gt; 
#&gt; The critical requirement of an effective graphical display is that it
#&gt; stimulate spontaneous perceptions of *structure* in data.
#&gt; --- S. Smith et al. 1990
#&gt; 
#&gt; Like good writing, producing an effective graphical display requires an
#&gt; understanding of *purpose*---*what* is to be communicated, and to
#&gt; *whom*.

#&gt; Have you ever seen voice mail?
#&gt; --- The Hackers Test
#&gt; 
#&gt; Graphics is the visual means of resolving logical problems.
#&gt; --- Jacques Bertin
#&gt; 
#&gt; The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
#&gt; never expected to see.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; If one technique of data analysis were to be exalted above all others
#&gt; for its ability to be revealing to the mind in connection with each of
#&gt; many different models, there is little doubt which one would be chosen.
#&gt; The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's
#&gt; mind than any other device. It specializes in providing indications of
#&gt; unexpected phenomena.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; Genius seems to consist merely in trueness of sight.
#&gt; --- Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1840
#&gt; 
#&gt; The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind.
#&gt; --- Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1860
#&gt; 
#&gt; Vision is the art of seeing things invisible.

#&gt; 
#&gt; When there is no vision, the people perish.

#&gt; 
#&gt; If I can't picture it, I can't understand it.
#&gt; --- Albert Einstein
#&gt; 
#&gt; And those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of
#&gt; the expanse of Heaven.
#&gt; --- Daniel 12:3
#&gt; 
#&gt; The one thing that marks the true artist is a clear perception and a
#&gt; firm, bold hand, in distinction from that imperfect mental vision and
#&gt; uncertain truth which give up the feeble pictures and the lumpy statues
#&gt; of the mere artisans on canvas or in stone.
#&gt; --- Oliver Wendell Holmes (1860), The Professor at the Breakfast Table
#&gt; Ticknor and Fields, Boston, MA
#&gt; 
#&gt; I like your motto: One picture is worth 1,000 denials.
#&gt; --- Ronald Reagan to White House News Photographers Assn, 18 May 1983
#&gt; 
#&gt; With brush you paint the possibilities with pens you scribe the
#&gt; probabilities for in pictures we find insight while in numbers find we
#&gt; strength.
#&gt; --- Forrest W. Young
#&gt; 
#&gt; A graphic should not only show the leaves it should show the branches
#&gt; as well as the entire tree.
#&gt; --- Jacques Bertin
#&gt; 
#&gt; Tables are like cobwebs, like the sieve of Danaides; beautifully
#&gt; reticulated, orderly to look upon, but which will hold no conclusion.
#&gt; Tables are abstractions, and the object a most concrete one, so
#&gt; difficult to read the essence of.
#&gt; --- From Chartism by Thomas Carlyle (1840), Chapter II, Statistics
#&gt; 
#&gt; A judicious man looks at Statistics, not to get knowledge, but to save
#&gt; himself from having ignorance foisted on him.
#&gt; --- Thomas Carlyle, Chartism Chapter II, Statistics
#&gt; 
#&gt; Although geometrical representations of propositions in the
#&gt; thermodynamics of fluids are in general use and have done good service
#&gt; in disseminating clear notions in this science, yet they have by no
#&gt; means received the extension in respect to variety and generality of
#&gt; which they are capable.
#&gt; --- J. Willard Gibbs, Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of
#&gt; Fluids, 1873
#&gt; 
#&gt; Although we often hear that data speak for themselves, their voices can
#&gt; be soft and sly.
#&gt; --- Mosteller, Fienberg and Rourke, Beginning Statistics with Data
#&gt; Analysis 1983, Reading MA, p. 234
#&gt; 
#&gt; Nocturne, of Chopin, so beautiful music. But few people will appreciate
#&gt; the music if I just show them the notes. Most of us need to listen to
#&gt; the music to understand how beautiful it is. But often that's how we
#&gt; present statistics; we just show the notes, we don't play the music.
#&gt; --- Hans Rosling, OECD World Forum, Istanbul, June 2007
#&gt; 
#&gt; The greatest possibilities of visual display lie in vividness and
#&gt; inescapability of the intended message. A visual display can stop your
#&gt; mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can
#&gt; force you to notice what you never expected to see.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; The purpose of [data] display is comparison (recognition of phenomena),
#&gt; not numbers ... The phenomena are the main actors, numbers are the
#&gt; supporting cast.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; If an editor should print bad English he would lose his position. Many
#&gt; editors are using and printing bad methods of graphic presentation, but
#&gt; they hold their jobs just the same.
#&gt; --- W. C. Brinton, Graphic methods of presenting facts 1914, p. 3
#&gt; 
#&gt; Around the turn of the century, Karl Pearson, an almost elemental force
#&gt; for more and better statistical thought in all areas of life, including
#&gt; with gusto, matters of social policy, was thinking and lecturing about
#&gt; graphical methods. But later in Pearson's life, and certainly in the
#&gt; careers of R. A. Fisher and the other great statistical minds of the
#&gt; first half of the century, there was a falling away of interest in
#&gt; graphics and an efflorescence of devotion to analytical mathematical
#&gt; methods. Indeed, for many years there was a contagious *snobbery*
#&gt; against so unpopular, vulgar and elementary a topic as graphics among
#&gt; academic statisticians and their students
#&gt; --- William Kruskal
#&gt; 
#&gt; If statistical graphics, although born just yesterday, extends its
#&gt; reach every day, it is because it replaces long tables of numbers and
#&gt; it allows one not only to embrace at glance the series of phenomena,
#&gt; but also to signal the correspondences or anomalies, to find the
#&gt; causes, to identify the laws.
#&gt; --- Emile Cheysson, c. 1877
#&gt; 
#&gt; Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them
#&gt; a clear and convincing voice
#&gt; --- Stephen Few
#&gt; 
#&gt; Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories
#&gt; --- Al Shalloway
#&gt; 
#&gt; The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures
#&gt; --- Ben Shneiderman
#&gt; 
#&gt; I love taxonomies, categories, ways of dividing people into groups
#&gt; --- Gretchen Rubin
#&gt; 
#&gt; Ballerinas are often divided into three categories: jumpers, turners
#&gt; and balancers
#&gt; --- Robert Gottlieb
#&gt; 
#&gt; Mr. Funkhouser has made an extremely interesting and valuable
#&gt; contribution to the history of statistical method. I wish, however,
#&gt; that he could have added a warning, supported by horrid examples, of
#&gt; the evils of the graphical method unsupported by tables of figures.
#&gt; Both for accurate understanding, and particularly to facilitate the use
#&gt; of the same material by other people, it is essential that graphs
#&gt; should not be published by themselves, but only when supported by the
#&gt; tables which lead up to them. It would be an exceedingly good rule to
#&gt; forbid in any scientific periodical the publication of graphs
#&gt; unsupported by tables.
#&gt; --- John Maynard Keynes, review of Funkhouser for The Economic Journal
#&gt; http://www.jstor.org/stable/2224943
#&gt; 
#&gt; Without data you are just another person with an opinion
#&gt; --- W. Edwards Deming
#&gt; 
#&gt; Without a plot you are just a person missing a convincing argument
#&gt; --- Di Cook, 2016
#&gt; 
#&gt; Whatever relates to extent and quantity may be represented by
#&gt; geometrical figures. Statistical projections which speak to the senses
#&gt; without fatiguing the mind, possess the advantage of fixing the
#&gt; attention on a great number of important facts.
#&gt; --- Alexander von Humboldt, , p. ciii
#&gt; 
#&gt; Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures, Quam quae sunt oculus
#&gt; subjecta fidelibus (Roughly: What we hear excites the mind less than
#&gt; what we see)
#&gt; --- Horace
#&gt; 
#&gt; You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.
#&gt; --- Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1890), "A
#&gt; Scandal in Bohemia", p. 162
#&gt; 
#&gt; Every picture tells a story.
#&gt; --- Rod Stewart, 1971
#&gt; 
#&gt; A picture is worth a ten thousand words.
#&gt; --- Fred R. Barnard, March 10 1927 in the advertising trade journal
#&gt; Printers Ink
#&gt; 
#&gt; ...But it is not always clear *which* 1000 words.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey, 1973
#&gt; 
#&gt; Un croquis vaut mieux qu'un long discours. Tr.: A good sketch is better
#&gt; than a long speech.

#&gt; Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue
#&gt; to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your
#&gt; flowcharts; they'll be obvious.
#&gt; --- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month
#&gt; 
#&gt; Look here, upon this picture, and on this.
#&gt; --- Shakespeare, Hamlet
#&gt; 
#&gt; I am only a picture-taster, the way others are wine- or tea-tasters.
#&gt; --- Bernard Berenson, Sunset and Twilight Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1963
#&gt; 
#&gt; Getting information from a table is like extracting sunlight from a
#&gt; cucumber.
#&gt; --- Farquhar &amp; Farquhar, 1891
#&gt; 
#&gt; When a law is contained in figures, it is buried like metal in an ore;
#&gt; it is necessary to extract it.  This is the work of graphical
#&gt; representation. It points out the coincidences, the relationships
#&gt; between phenomena, their anomalies, and we have seen what a powerful
#&gt; means of control it puts in the hands of the statistician to verify new
#&gt; data, discover and correct errors with which they have been stained.
#&gt; --- Emile Cheysson, Les methods de la statistique (1890), 34-35.
#&gt; 
#&gt; [When] you see excellent graphics, find out how they were done. Borrow
#&gt; strength from demonstrated excellence.  The idea for information design
#&gt; is: Don't get it original, get it right.
#&gt; --- Edward Tufte
#&gt; 
#&gt; Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.
#&gt; --- Joe Sparano, graphic designer for Oxide Design Co.
#&gt; 
#&gt; Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not
#&gt; design, it's decoration.
#&gt; --- Jeffrey Zeldman, web designer and entrepreneur
#&gt; 
#&gt; Mankind is not a circle with a single center but an ellipse with two
#&gt; focal points of which facts are one and ideas the other.
#&gt; --- Victor Hugo
#&gt; 
#&gt; So, Fabricius, I already have this: that the most true path of the
#&gt; planet [Mars] is an ellipse, which Durer also calls an oval, or
#&gt; certainly so close to an ellipse that the difference is insensible
#&gt; --- Johannes Kepler, 1605
#&gt; 
#&gt; `Data! data!' he cried impatiently.  I can't make bricks without clay.
#&gt; --- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes "The Copper
#&gt; Beeches"
#&gt; 
#&gt; I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has
#&gt; data.
#&gt; --- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes "A Scandal in
#&gt; Bohemia"
#&gt; 
#&gt; This was an unexpected piece of luck. My data were coming more quickly
#&gt; than I could have reasonably hoped.
#&gt; --- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Musgrave Ritual
#&gt; 
#&gt; I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any
#&gt; insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of
#&gt; your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your
#&gt; theories.
#&gt; --- Arthur Conan-Doyle, His Last Bow, Wisteria Lodge
#&gt; 
#&gt; It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
#&gt; --- Sherlock Homes in Scandal in Bohemia
#&gt; 
#&gt; The only thing we know for sure about a missing data point is that it
#&gt; is not there, and there is nothing that the magic of statistics can do
#&gt; do change that.  The best that can be managed is to estimate the extent
#&gt; to which missing data have influenced the inferences we wish to draw.
#&gt; --- Howard Wainer, 2009
#&gt; 
#&gt; Big data can change the way social science is performed, but will not
#&gt; replace statistical common sense.

#&gt; Baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half is physical.

#&gt; In God we trust. All others must bring data.
#&gt; --- W. Edwards Deming
#&gt; 
#&gt; The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does
#&gt; not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body
#&gt; of data.

#&gt; Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can
#&gt; be counted counts.
#&gt; --- Albert Einstein
#&gt; 
#&gt; Whenever you can, count.
#&gt; --- Francis Galton, quoted in Newman
#&gt; 
#&gt; It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their
#&gt; inquiries to Averages, and do not revel in more comprehensive views.
#&gt; Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the native
#&gt; of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland was that,
#&gt; if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two nuisances would be
#&gt; got rid of at once.
#&gt; --- Francis Galton in Natural Inheritance
#&gt; 
#&gt; Winwood Reade is good upon the subject. He remarks that, while the
#&gt; individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a
#&gt; mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any
#&gt; one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number
#&gt; will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So
#&gt; says the statistician.
#&gt; --- Arthur Conan-Doyle, Sign of the Four
#&gt; 
#&gt; If you put a buttock on a hot plate and another one on an ice cube, the
#&gt; average is good, but in reality your bottom is in trouble.
#&gt; --- Grigore Moisil
#&gt; 
#&gt; The graphical method has considerable superiority for the exposition of
#&gt; statistical facts over the tabular. A heavy bank of figures is
#&gt; grievously wearisome to the eye, and the popular mind is as incapable
#&gt; of drawing any useful lessons from it as of extracting sunbeams from
#&gt; cucumbers.
#&gt; --- Arthur B. &amp; Henry Farquhar (1891). Economic and Industrial
#&gt; Delusions

#&gt; Let it serve for table-talk.

#&gt; --- William Shakespeare. Macbeth, Act III, Sc. 4.
#&gt; 
#&gt; Isolated facts, those that can only be obtained by rough estimate and
#&gt; that require development, can only be presented in memoires; but those
#&gt; that can be presented in a body, with details, and on whose accuracy
#&gt; one can rely, may be expounded in tables.
#&gt; --- E. Duvillard, Memoire sur le travail du Bureau de statistique 1806;
#&gt; cited in
#&gt; 
#&gt; There is a magic in graphs. The profile of a curve reveals in a flash a
#&gt; whole situation---the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era
#&gt; of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination,
#&gt; convinces.
#&gt; --- Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic
#&gt; Presentation
#&gt; 
#&gt; Graphs carry the message home. A universal language, graphs convey
#&gt; information directly to the mind. Without complexity there is imaged to
#&gt; the eye a magnitude to be remembered. Words have wings, but graphs
#&gt; interpret. Graphs are pure quantity, stripped of verbal sham, reduced
#&gt; to dimension, vivid, unescapable.
#&gt; --- Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic
#&gt; Presentation
#&gt; 
#&gt; Graphs are all inclusive. No fact is too slight or too great to plot to
#&gt; a scale suited to the eye. Graphs may record the path of an ion or the
#&gt; orbit of the sun, the rise of a civilization, or the acceleration of a
#&gt; bullet, the climate of a century or the varying pressure of a heart
#&gt; beat, the growth of a business, or the nerve reactions of a child.
#&gt; --- Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic
#&gt; Presentation
#&gt; 
#&gt; The graphic art depicts magnitudes to the eye. It does more. It compels
#&gt; the seeing of relations. We may portray by simple graphic methods whole
#&gt; masses of intricate routine, the organization of an enterprise, or the
#&gt; plan of a campaign. Graphs serve as storm signals for the manager,
#&gt; statesman, engineer; as potent narratives for the actuary, statist,
#&gt; naturalist; and as forceful engines of research for science, technology
#&gt; and industry. They display results. They disclose new facts and laws.
#&gt; They reveal discoveries as the bud unfolds the flower.
#&gt; --- Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic
#&gt; Presentation
#&gt; 
#&gt; The graphic language is modern. We are learning its alphabet. That it
#&gt; will develop a lexicon and a literature marvelous for its vividness and
#&gt; the variety of application is inevitable. Graphs are dynamic, dramatic.
#&gt; They may epitomize an epoch, each dot a fact, each slope an event, each
#&gt; curve a history. Wherever there are data to record, inferences to draw,
#&gt; or facts to tell, graphs furnish the unrivalled means whose power we
#&gt; are just beginning to realize and to apply.
#&gt; --- Henry D. Hubbard, in Foreword to Brinton (1939), Graphic
#&gt; Presentation
#&gt; 
#&gt; Functional visualizations are more than innovative statistical analyses
#&gt; and computational algorithms. They must make sense to the user and
#&gt; require a visual language system that uses colour, shape, line,
#&gt; hierarchy and composition to communicate clearly and appropriately,
#&gt; much like the alphabetic and character-based languages used worldwide
#&gt; between humans.
#&gt; --- Matt Woolman, Digital Information Graphics

#&gt; In One Dimensions, did not a moving Point produce a Line with two
#&gt; terminal points? In two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a
#&gt; Square wit four terminal points? In Three Dimensions, did not a moving
#&gt; Square produce - did not the eyes of mine behold it - that blessed
#&gt; being, a Cube, with eight terminal points? And in Four Dimensions,
#&gt; shall not a moving Cube - alas, for Analogy, and alas for the Progress
#&gt; of Truth if it be not so - shall not, I say the motion of a divine Cube
#&gt; result in a still more divine organization with sixteen terminal
#&gt; points?
#&gt; --- Edwin A. Abbott, Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions
#&gt; 
#&gt; To comport oneself with perfect propriety in Polygonal society, one
#&gt; ought to be a Polygon oneself.
#&gt; --- Edwin A. Abbott, Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions
#&gt; 
#&gt; True, said the Sphere; it appears to you a Plane, because you are not
#&gt; accustomed to light and shade and perspective; just as in Flatland a
#&gt; Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one who has not the Art of
#&gt; Sight Recognition. But in reality it is a Solid, as you shall learn by
#&gt; the sense of Feeling.
#&gt; --- Edwin A. Abbott, Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions

#&gt; There are twenty one mystical dimensions of consciousness.
#&gt; Enlightenment is abiding in the highest three dimensions of

#&gt; Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at
#&gt; all.

#&gt; The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
#&gt; never expected to see.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; If one technique of data analysis were to be exalted above all others
#&gt; for its ability to be revealing to the mind in connection with each of
#&gt; many different models, there is little doubt which one would be chosen.
#&gt; The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's
#&gt; mind than any other device. It specializes in providing indications of
#&gt; unexpected phenomena.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; The greatest possibilities of visual display lie in vividness and
#&gt; inescapability of the intended message. A visual display can stop your
#&gt; mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can
#&gt; force you to notice what you never expected to see.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; The purpose of [data] display is comparison (recognition of phenomena),
#&gt; not numbers ... The phenomena are the main actors, numbers are the
#&gt; supporting cast.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; ...But it is not always clear *which* 1000 words.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey, 1973
#&gt; 
#&gt; Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing
#&gt; else can serve as the foundation stone -- as the first step.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey, EDA, 1977, p.3.
#&gt; 
#&gt; The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in
#&gt; everyone's backyard.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often
#&gt; vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be
#&gt; made precise.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey, (1962), "The future of data analysis," Annals of
#&gt; Mathematical Statistics 33, 1-67.
#&gt; 
#&gt; A bad answer to a good question may be far better than a good answer to
#&gt; a bad question.
#&gt; --- A graduate class, paraphrasing Tukeys dictum.
#&gt; 
#&gt; The worst, i.e., most dangerous, feature of 'accepting the null
#&gt; hypothesis' is the giving up of explicit uncertainty ... Mathematics
#&gt; can sometimes be put in such black-and-white terms, but our knowledge
#&gt; or belief about the external world never can.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey. (1991). "The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons,"
#&gt; Statistical Science 6, 100--116.
#&gt; 
#&gt; Better to have an approximate answer to the right question than a
#&gt; precise answer to the wrong question.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey as quoted by John Chambers
#&gt; 
#&gt; The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does
#&gt; not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body
#&gt; of data.
#&gt; --- John W. Tukey
#&gt; 
#&gt; The practical power of a statistical test is the product of its'
#&gt; statistical power and the probability of use.
