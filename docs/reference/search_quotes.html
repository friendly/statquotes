<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> that statistics is the discipline concerned with the study of</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> The physical sciences are used to 'praying over' their data, examining</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> Without this sort of flexibility, progress in physical science would</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> have been much slower. Flexibility in analysis is often to be had</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> honestly at the price of a willingness not to demand that what has</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> already been observed shall establish, or prove, what analysis</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> suggests. In physical science generally, the results of praying over</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> the data are thought of as something to be put to further test in</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> answer with a lie, one that was often a downright lie. They asked "Are</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> the effects of A and B different?" and they were willing to answer</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> "no". All we know about the world teaches us that the effects of A and</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> B are always different--in some decimal place--for every A and B. Thus</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> asking "Are the effects different?" is foolish. What we should be</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> answering first is "Can we tell the direction in which the effects of A</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> differ from the effects of B?" In other words, can we be confident</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> about the direction from A to B? Is it "up", "down" or "uncertain"?</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> use Q1 - 1.5 x IQR (or Q3 + 1.5 x IQR) as the value for deciding if a</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> data value is classified as an outlier? Paul Velleman, a statistician</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> at Cornell University, was a student of John Tukey, who invented the</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> boxplot and the 1.5 x IQR Rule. When he asked Tukey, 'Why 1.5?', Tukey</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> answered, 'Because 1 is too small and 2 is too large.' [Assuming a</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> Gaussian distribution, about 1 value in 100 would be an outlier. Using</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 2 x IQR would lead to 1 value in 1000 being an outlier.]</span>
