\title{Parse quotes from the file quotes_raw.txt.}
\usage{
read_quotes_raw(file = file.path(getwd(), "data-raw/quotes_raw.txt"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The file of raw quotes.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with quotes
}
\description{
There should be no reason for a person to call this function.
This function parses `data-raw/quotes_raw.txt`.
The resulting dataframe is then saved to `data/quotes.rda`.
Although it would be possible to use this function to parse
the quotes when loading the package, that would make it much
slower to load the package.
