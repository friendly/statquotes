## statquotes package released to CRAN

The statquotes package v. 0.2 has recently been released to CRAN.  In a spirit
similar to fortunes and gaussfacts, the function `statquote()`  
displays a randomly chosen quotation from a data base consisting
of quotes about topics related to statistics, data visualization and science. 

The data base is a collection of quotations assembled over the years from various
sources. The quotes are classified by general topics (and subtopics).
